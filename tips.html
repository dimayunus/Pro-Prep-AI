                        <h3>Be on time:</h3>
                        <p>This often means 10-15 minutes early. Interviewers often are ready before the appointment.</p>

                        <p>There is nothing wrong with having a short list of questions and thoughts.<br>
                        It shows you have done your research and want to know more about the organization and the position.</p>

                        <h3>Expect to spend some time developing rapport.</h3>
                        <p>Don't jump right in and get down to business. Follow the interviewer's lead.</p>

                        <p>Be sure you understand the question; if not, ask for clarification, or restate it in your own words.<br>
                        Answer completely and concisely. Stick to the subject at hand.</p>

                        Even if you have to go slowly and correct yourself, accuracy is preferred over ungrammatical fluency.</p>
